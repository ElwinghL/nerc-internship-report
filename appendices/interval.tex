\section{Time Interval CHDK Script}
\label{app:interval}

The script used to take pictures every 5 seconds is as follows:

\begin{minted}{lua}
    --[[
    @title Intervalometer
    @param a = interval (sec)
    @default a 5
    @param b = number of photos
    @default -1
    --]]
    repeat
        start = get_tick_count()
        shoot()
        sleep(a*1000 - (get_tick_count() - start))
        b = b - 1
    until (b = 0)
\end{minted}

This is adapted from the default \texttt{interval.lua} script, packaged with all
versions of CHDK under the \texttt{SCRIPTS} directory. Note that there are two
parameters: \texttt{a} is the time interval between successive photos, in
seconds, which we set to 5, and \texttt{b} is the number of photos to take in
total. By default, this is set to \texttt{-1}, meaning it will continue taking
photos indefinitely, however it can be useful to limit the number of photos.
