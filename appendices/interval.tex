\section{Time Interval CHDK Script}
\label{app:interval}

The script used to take pictures every 5 seconds is as follows:

\inputminted{lua}{code/number-interval.lua}

This is adapted from the default \texttt{interval.lua} script, packaged with all
versions of CHDK under the \texttt{SCRIPTS} directory. Note that there are two
parameters: \texttt{a} is the time interval between successive photos, in
seconds, which we set to 5, and \texttt{b} is the number of photos to take in
total. By default, this is set to \texttt{-1}, meaning it will continue taking
photos indefinitely, however it can be useful to limit the number of photos.
