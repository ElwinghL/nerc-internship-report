\subsection{Ensuring sufficient photo overlap}

Agisoft states in the PhotoScan User Manual\footnote{PhotoScan 1.0.0 user
Manual, ``Capturing Scenarios'', Page 5.
\url{http://downloads.agisoft.ru/pdf/photoscan-pro\_1\_0\_0\_en.pdf}} that 80\%
overlap is needed for standard front overlap between successive photos. Thus,
one can calculate the speed one needs to travel at to ensure that if one takes
photos every five seconds, the overlap is at least 80\%.
