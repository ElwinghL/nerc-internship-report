\section{Future Projects}

The following are proposals for future research into this field:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Assess the relative accuracy achieved by using the CAM geotagging
        method as opposed to the time interval CHDK script.
    \item Further investigate the possible applications of photogrammetry to
        different areas of Earth Science.
\end{itemize}
