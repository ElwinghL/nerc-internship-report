\section{Results}

This is where I'll state and compare the results form my experiments.

\subsection{Zenithal versus Oblique}
\label{sec:results/zenithal-versus-oblique}

Practical comparison of the difference between Avon Gorge models built using
zenithal (Pass 1) and oblique (Pass 2) photos, including their accuracy, error,
precision and general visual fidelity.

\subsection{Geotagging Accuracy}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Measurement of accuracy of time offset method (with reference to
        PhotoScan generated report statistics).

    \item Measurement of accuracy of CAM log method (if possible, with reference
        to PhotoScan generated report statistics).

    \item Comparison of relative accuracy of time offset and CAM log methods (if
        possible).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ground Control Point Accuracy}

Which GCPs produced the biggest errors and why. Sources of stated errors in
PhotoScan generated report.

\subsection{Model and DEM Analysis}

\begin{itemize}

    \item PhotoScan calculated meters per pixel.

    \item Error - find out where PhotoScan calculates this from!

    \item Photographics overlap

\end{itemize}
